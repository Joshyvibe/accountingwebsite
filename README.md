# accountingwebsite
This is a six pages accounting/taxation website built for accounting consulting firms.
I used Python Django as my back-end
Its functions include a login/signup page (I used a django forms package called crispy forms)
Here are the pip installed you must have on your terminal for this website to function.
pip install django
pip install django-crispy-forms

I have added a picture description of what this site looks like if properly installed.
